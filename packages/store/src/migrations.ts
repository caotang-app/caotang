/**
 * Migration registry — [project-format.md §6](docs/architecture/project-format.md).
 *
 * §6 in full, because every rule below is transcribed from it rather than
 * invented: "Migrations run **load-time, in-memory first**: `v(n) → v(n+1)`
 * functions in a fixed registry, each with a unit test fixture pair. A migration
 * failure aborts the open with the project untouched." … "Writers always save at
 * the **current** version (no rolling forward on unrelated edits)."
 *
 * Four decisions are load-bearing and each is enforced structurally, not by
 * convention:
 *
 *   1. **The chain must be contiguous.** A missing `v(n) → v(n+1)` step is a hard
 *      failure naming the exact version, never a silent skip. A registry that
 *      quietly stopped at the first gap would hand the caller a manifest that
 *      claims to be current and is not — the one failure mode a migration
 *      cannot have, because §2 step 2 already refuses to guess-upgrade.
 *   2. **The runner owns the version stamp.** A migration returns *content*; the
 *      runner writes `formatVersion` from the step it is on. A migration that
 *      returns a wrong or missing version therefore cannot desync the chain.
 *   3. **The caller's object is never mutated.** The chain starts from a deep
 *      clone, which is what makes "the project untouched" true even when a
 *      migration mutates its own argument in place and a later step throws. On
 *      failure the caller holds the object it passed in, byte for byte.
 *   4. **The registry is empty, and that is correct.** §2's note is that
 *      "no wild artifacts exist before implementation; versioning starts at first
 *      release", and §6's first line is "v1 is the first stable format". There has
 *      never been a v0, so there is no `v(n) → v(n+1)` to register. Seeding a fake
 *      v0 would invent a format version that never shipped, and the machinery
 *      below is therefore tested against a synthetic registry plus fixture pairs
 *      in `test/migrations.test.ts` — which also asserts that every registered
 *      migration has a fixture, so adding the first real one cannot skip the
 *      pair §6 requires.
