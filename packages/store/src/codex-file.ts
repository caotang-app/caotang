/**
 * Codex redundancy-file codec — [codex.md §3](docs/architecture/codex.md).
 *
 * codex.md §3 is normative and unambiguous about the file: "`codex/<id>.md` —
 * YAML front matter `{id, name, type, includePolicy, caseSensitive, aliases,
 * exclude, attachments, keywords}` + body = `description` Markdown. Written on
 * every entry save via the same atomic write path as documents."
 *
 * That is the whole point of the file. The codex is the knowledge base an agent
 * maintains for a long book, and codex.md §3 calls this redundancy "the direct
 * countermeasure to the Manuskript corpus (single-asset corruption = unreadable
 * project)". A recovery pass that scans for files the write path never produced
 * is not a recovery pass, so this codec and the writer that uses it are built
 * together.
 *
 * The shape is the same front-matter-plus-body shape as a document file, with a
 * different key set — which is why the parser itself is shared with
 * {@link parseFrontMatter} and only the *interpretation* of the fields lives
 * here. Note that `description` is the body, not a key: codex.md §3 puts it
 * there so the entry reads as prose in any Markdown viewer.
